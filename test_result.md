# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "Attempted to test the Prospecting for Intent dashboard frontend. Installed missing 'lucide-react' dependency and restarted the frontend service. However, the preview URLs (both https://99bd6dfb-f47c-4871-80bb-13e24af33ba0.preview.emergentagent.com/ and https://bcfadc05-47d4-4401-8547-56a7e2fbdcc1.preview.emergentagent.com/) are returning 'Preview Unavailable' errors. The backend API is working correctly when accessed directly at http://localhost:8001/api/, returning proper lead data. The frontend is also running correctly on http://localhost:3000 according to curl checks, but Playwright cannot access it due to preview URL limitations."

      message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the Growth Signals dashboard at https://99bd6dfb-f47c-4871-80bb-13e24af33ba0.preview.emergentagent.com/. The website is now fully functional with all components working correctly. The dashboard UI loads properly with Silver Birch Growth branding, the leads table displays and filters correctly, the Twitter signals feed shows relevant tweets, and the news section displays properly formatted news items. The search and filtering functionality works as expected. There are some network errors in the console related to aborted API requests, but these don't affect the functionality of the application as the data is still being displayed correctly."

      message: "Tested the enhanced Prospecting for Intent dashboard at https://99bd6dfb-f47c-4871-80bb-13e24af33ba0.preview.emergentagent.com/ based on the specific requirements. The page loads without errors. There is a single targeting input with the correct placeholder text about 'Founders of startups scaling GPUs based in NA'. The 'GO' button (not 'Analyze') is present and functional. When entering 'GPU startups' in the input and clicking GO, the tweets and news sections update with relevant content. The tweets section is in a right sidebar that's flush with the leads section and is designed to be scrollable (has overflow-y: auto CSS property), but may not show scrollbars unless there are enough tweets to exceed the container height. All LinkedIn and website links have valid formats and work correctly. The dynamic AI functionality works as expected, updating the content based on user input."
